## Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name Peter Christie and I'm currently a software engineer at **Meta** working on improving the authoring experience for AI/ML developers. Before that, I worked on observability in trading infrastructure at **Citibank**.

I graduated Williams College in 2020 with degrees in Computer Science and Biology, and have lived in NYC since 2021.

Check back for future updates...
